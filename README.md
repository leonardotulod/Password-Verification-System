# Password-Verification-System
Created a custom Merkle Tree to verify passwords using their hash codes. Allowing for safe storage and retrieval using input files and creating/exporting to a file named with the correct hashcode. The correct password should one word with no spaces and it should be a .txt file. Happy verifying!
